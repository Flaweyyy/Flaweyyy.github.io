                <h2 class="textleft">Introduction</h2> <br>
                <p class="textleft">The Honda Civic is a compact car known for its reliability, fuel efficiency, and
                    practicality. First
                    introduced in 1972, the Civic has evolved through multiple generations, offering various body styles
                    including sedan, coupe, and hatchback. It is popular among commuters, students, and driving
                    enthusiasts alike.</p> <br> <br>

                <h2 class="textleft">A Brief History</h2> <br>
                <p class="textleft">The first-generation Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door fastback sedan,
                    followed by a
                    three-door hatchback that September. With a 1169 CC transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the
                    car provided good interior space despite its small overall dimensions. Initially gaining a
                    reputation for being fuel-efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly, later iterations have
                    become known for performance and sportiness, especially the Civic Si, SiR, and Type R
                    versions. It is currently in its eleventh generation, which has been produced since 2021.</p> <br>

                <p class="textleft">Launched in July 1972, the original Honda Civic was a compact, front-wheel-drive
                    car, offered initially as a 2-door model and later as a 3-door hatchback. It featured Honda's CVCC
                    engine, which cleverly met U.S. emission standards without
                    requiring a catalytic converter. It quickly earned a reputation for
                    reliability, simplicity, and efficiency, helping Honda gain a
                    foothold in North America.</p> <br>

                    The fourth generation had emphasized aerodynamic design and better fuel economy. Pairing that with
                    Honda's iconic VTEC (Variable Valve Timing) technology, this generation of civic became very popular
                    among enthusiasts and tuners.</p>

                <p class="textleft">
                    This is around the time Honda introduced the Civic Hybrid in 2003 to compete with the Toyota Prius.
                    Sportier, futuristic design, especially in the coupe and Si models. The Civic Si got a high-revving
                    2.0L engine and 6-speed manual. It also received a high-quality interior with a split-level digital
                    dashboard, considered very modern at the time.

                <p class="textleft">
                    The sedan model was first unveiled in the U.S. in September 2015, for the 2016 model year. The
                    tenth-generation Civic features a new fastback exterior design, with the rear C-pillar flowing into
                    the tailgate. The front of the car features a new chrome wing design that flows across the top of
                    the headlamps. Civic body styles include sedan, coupe, five-door hatchback, while performance models
                    include Si trims and Type R models. This would be the second newest generation, soon to be followed
                    up by the eleventh generation civic, which is what we know today.

                    Garage Taiwan. It's famous for being one of the lowest cars in the world, with its extremely low
                    profile making it appear as if it's clipping through the ground. The car is designed for exhibitions
                    and is controlled by a driver lying down inside, using cameras for navigation, as there is no room
                    to sit upright.</p>

                <p class="textleft">The Honda Civic Type R is the high-performance version of the Civic, featuring a
                    turbocharged
                    2.0-liter engine with around 315 horsepower and a 6-speed manual transmission. It includes upgrades
                    like adaptive suspension, Brembo brakes, and a limited-slip differential for sharp handling. The
                    aggressive styling, rear wing, and sporty interior with bucket seats and performance displays
                    emphasize its track-ready nature. While there's usually one main Type R trim, special editions offer
                    lighter weight and enhanced features for even more focused performance.</p>

                <!-- slap an image here -->
                <p class="textleft">VTEC (Variable Valve Timing and Lift Electronic Control) is Honda's signature engine
                    technology designed to improve performance and efficiency. It works by adjusting valve timing and
                    lift based on engine speed, allowing for better fuel economy at low RPMs and increased power at high
                    RPMs. Introduced in the late 1980s, VTEC became iconic in performance models like the Civic Si and
                    Type R, delivering a noticeable surge in power—often called the “VTEC kick”—when the system engages.
                    It's known for blending everyday drivability with sporty performance.</p>

                <!-- slap an image here -->
                <p class="textleft">Honda engines are engineered for excellent fuel economy without compromising
                    reliability or performance. By optimizing valve control, reducing engine weight, and refining
                    aerodynamics, Honda vehicles achieve strong mileage across city and highway driving. This makes them
                    a practical choice for daily commuters who want efficiency along with a smooth, responsive driving
                    experience.</p>
